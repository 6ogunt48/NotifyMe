checkemailbot is a telegram bot I used to monitor my 3 email accounts.it checks all 3 email accounts at the same time
and returns back the number of unread emails found in those accounts to telegram.it has to function to manually check
the email using the bot commands on the telegram app and also automatically checks the emails every 5 hours.
