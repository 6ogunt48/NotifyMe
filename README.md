Checkemailbot is a telegram bot I use for monitoring my email accounts.it checks all email accounts specified in
config.toml at the same time and returns the number of unread emails found in those accounts to telegram. You can
either check
the email using the bot commands on the telegram app or wait for the bot to check and send results notification at the
specified interval
time in config.
